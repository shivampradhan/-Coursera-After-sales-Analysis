# After Sale Student Analysis

Data Analytics After-Sales
As an After-Sales Analyst, you will be confronted daily with many databases and systems related to
the study, supervision, administration, etc. of the students.
It is important for our service departments to understand who the student is and who contacts us to
be able to deliver the best possible support. The goal is to always keep an eye on customer
satisfaction and to understand what it largely depends on. This is what you will explore in this case
study.
Data sets
You have 3 records in the form of csv files.

**Task 1**
Analyze the data with Python! Important KPIs in our field are:
Study progress, contact rates and cancellation rates (they all affect customer satisfaction).
Here are some sample questions you can ask yourself and answer with the data:

- Are there differences in study progress (ECTS earned) between study programmes?
- Which age group has the best study progression?
- Are women more likely to quit than men?
- Do emails have an influence on cancellations?
- And expand as you like :-)
Feel free to define the KPIs as you consider appropriate and logical.
**Task 2**
The team leader of student service department needs a new dashboard to monitor the daily
performance of their team. Please provide the team leader with a first version of the dashboard.
Use Power BI for this task.
